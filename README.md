# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project was made for the purpose of creating a guide for students beggining the journey of learning to code.
This project was created for the purpose of making studying easier and more accesable. I got my motivation for this from my prior years of school. I would always struggle to study because there is so much information you can find on the internet, but when you have spot were you can see everything resumed. I learned the purpose of the bootcamp, as in creating a website and all the components that come with it.
